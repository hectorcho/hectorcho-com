Welcome to my blog.
My name is Hector Cho and I am an aspiring neuroscientist. I graduated from
Columbia in 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

Currently, I work as a Research Staff Assistant at the [Issa Lab](https://issalab.neuroscience.columbia.edu/) @ Columbia's [Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/). Previously I worked at the [Bionet Group](www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu) with Professor Lazar working on the Central Complex (CX) model of the Drosophila brain.
Before that I was a Columbia SURF fellow at [LIINC](liinc.bme.columbia.edu) with Professor Sajda.
