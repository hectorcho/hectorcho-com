In this blog post, I will be sharing my thoughts on 
[Yamins and DiCarlo's 2016 Nature Neuroscience Perspective][article-link]
piece.

This article, titled **Using goal-driven deep learning models to understand
sensory cortex** gives a summary and and overview of the works that Yamins and
DiCarlo produced since 2014. (2014 is when Yamins published a landmark paper
[(Yamins et al., 2014)][yamins-2014-pnas] in which he describes a CNN that can
explain ~50% of the variance when optimized for performance on core object
recognition task)
