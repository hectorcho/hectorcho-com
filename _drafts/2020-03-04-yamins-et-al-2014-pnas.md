Welcome to my blog and my first post! I thought I would write a
blog post every time I read a paper. By writing about new ideas and papers
in the field, I hope to not only attempt to better understand neuroscience
concepts but also communicate with anyone about anything neuroscience. I am
still very much learning and would love feedback from anyone taking the time
to read my posts.


In 2014, Dan Yamins who was working with Jim DiCarlo at the time at MIT
published this landmark paper titled
[**Perforamce-optimized hierarchical models predict neural responses in higher visual cortex**][yamins-pnas-2014].
This paper was surprising because the convolutional neural network explained
more than 50% of the variance in IT
