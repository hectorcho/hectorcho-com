[**Explicit information for category-orthogonal object properties increases along the ventral stream**][hong-natneuro-2016] Hong et al., Nat. Neuro (2016)


We've looked at multiple papers exploring and expanding the paradigm developed
in [**Yamins et al (2014)**][yamins-pnas-2014]. Just as a recap, Yamins et al (2014).,
implemented a convolutional neural network optimized for object classification task
performance and was able to linearly decode macaque neural response that predicted
about 48% of the explainable IT neural response variance (visit [**Brain-Score**][brainscore]
for more recent developments in predicting neural response of various areas along the visual
stream). This CNN, which the paper calls hierarchical modular optimization (HMO) model, also
performed object classification at the human performance level.


This [paper][hong-natneuro-2016] probes whether ventral visual areas build a robust
representation of 'category-orthogonal' object properties such as position, size,
aspect ratio, etc. It also tackles whether these 'category-orthogonal' object property
information is lost or preserved along the visual stream.


Previous research have shown that robust representations of objects are built along
the ventral visual stream to support visual object categorization. However, it cannot
be the case that visual perception only concerns itself with categorization as humans
are able to estimate other object-related properties such as object position, size,
aspect ratio and orientation. While these category-orthogonal properties are often
considered to be 'nuisance' variables that are thrown away along the ventral visual
stream, our ability to relatively precisely estimate those properties show that some
of these information is preserved. Then the question becomes how the ar
